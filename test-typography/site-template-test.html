							In the quiet hours of early spring, when the mist still clings to
							distant peaks and birds begin their morning chorus, I find myself
							returning to the classical poets. There's something about their
							economy of language, the way twenty characters can contain an
							entire world, that speaks to a truth beyond mere words.
						</p>

						<p>
							The Tang poets understood this implicitly. When Meng Haoran woke
							on a spring morning, he didn't need elaborate description—just the
							essence of the moment, the sound of birds, the memory of rain, the
							fallen blossoms.

						<h2>The Complexity of Simplicity</h2>

						<p>
							But not all poetry works the same way. Some poems build their
							meaning through accumulation, through the patient layering of
							image upon image. Tao Yuanming, writing centuries earlier in the
							Jin Dynasty, often worked in longer lines, with translations that
							resist the compressed elegance of the Tang masters.
						</p>

						<p>
							Consider his meditation on reading, where the physical pleasures
							of wine and vegetables merge with the imaginative pleasures of
							ancient texts. The English translation unfolds at a different
							pace, with indentation marking the rhythm:

						<h2>Bilingual Considerations</h2>

						<p>
							When we present these poems bilingually, we face an interesting
							design challenge. The Chinese original, with its vertical columns
							reading right-to-left, occupies a completely different spatial
							logic than the English translation. The five-character lines fit
							naturally into narrow columns; the English sprawls horizontally,
							resistant to constraint.
						</p>

						<p>
							Let me show the same Tao Yuanming poem again, this time with both
							languages displayed together:

						<h2>Conclusion</h2>

						<p>
							Typography is never neutral. The way we arrange text on a page
							shapes how we read it, what we notice, how we pause. For classical
							Chinese poetry, the vertical column isn't just decorative—it's
							part of the reading experience, a visual echo of the calligraphic
							tradition from which these poems emerged.
						</p>

						<p>
							But that's a topic for another day. For now, I'll return to my
							books, to the pleasure of covering entire worlds without leaving
							my cottage.
