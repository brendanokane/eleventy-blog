# To the tune of "The Unbreakable Strings"

```
布衣中，問英雄：
王圖霸業成何用？
禾黍高低六代宮，
楸梧遠近千官塚：
一場惡夢。

```
Standing in humble homespun robes,
I question history’s men of great esteem:
What use were all your kingly plans;
How long endured the tyrant’s scheme?
Palaces from the Six Dynasties
Now fertilize the farmer’s grain,
And scraggly catalpa trees
Mark loyal ministers’ remains:
All history is one bad dream.
```
