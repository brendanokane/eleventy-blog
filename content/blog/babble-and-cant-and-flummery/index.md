# Babble and Cant and Flummery

A couple years ago, before I ever started translating Yuan _sanqu_ (or any other poetry) for fun, I heard a minimalist electronic setting of a few _sanqu_ by Dou Wei 窦唯 and Zhao Jian 朝简 that starts off with a real scorcher:

> **譏時**
>
> 鋪眉苫眼早三公，
>
> 裸袖揎拳享萬鍾，
>
> 胡言亂語成時用。
>
> 大綱來都是哄！

> **The Times We Live In**
>
> Cozen. Flatter. Ingratiate —
>
> The Three High Offices of state.
>
> Bared fists and naked thuggery
>
> Net a seven-figure salary,
>
> And babble’s often all you’ll hear of late.
>
> It’s all just cant and flummery!
>
> — Zhang Mingshan 張鳴善, fl. 14th century

This draft is kind of a failure, or at least not yet a success: the first half of the lyric, which I’ve translated here, works well enough, but the second half is a lot denser, and I think the footnotes would probably outweigh the payoff. <sup class="mn-marker" data-mn-id="mn-1" aria-controls="mn-1" aria-expanded="false" title="Toggle note">※</sup> Can’t win them all, I guess.
<aside class="mn-note" id="mn-1" data-mn-id="mn-1" hidden>

The second stanza gets a lot denser in a way that doesn’t lend itself to unobtrusive translation. This is probably a limitation of my approach, particularly my general allergy to encumbrances in literary translations — though who knows; maybe inspiration will strike as soon as I hit “Post” — but if you’re wondering what you’re missing:

> 說英雄誰是英雄？
>
> 五眼鷄岐山鳴鳳，
>
> 兩頭蛇南陽卧龍，
>
> 三脚貓渭水飛熊。
>
> They talk about heroes — well, who’s a hero?
>
> \[They’d say\]
>
> A five-eyed rooster was the phoenix of Mount Qi,
>
> A two-headed snake was a dragon in disguise,
>
> Or a three-legged cat was the “non-bear” of the Wei!

Besides continuing the first stanza’s pattern of having a number in every line but the last — did you spot the hidden “ten?” — these are all classical allusions:

- "Phoenix of Mount Qi" 岐山鳴鳳 - in the _Discourses of the States_ 國語 there's a reference to a phoenix on Mt. Qi, a symbol of virtue, ability, and all-around worthiness.

- “Dragon in disguise” 南陽卧龍 - this is Zhuge Liang 諸葛亮, the historical Shu Han 蜀漢 strategist portrayed in the novel _Three Kingdoms_ 三國志通俗演義 (which didn’t exist yet, though its source materials did) as a sort of Merlin figure.

- “Non-bear of the Wei”渭水飛（非）熊 — this is Jiang Ziya 姜子牙, the Zhou 周 general who helped bring down the Shang 商 dynasty, via a bad pun. (A diviner had told King Wen that if he went hunting on the north bank of the Wei river, he would catch something wonderful — but not a dragon, and not a tiger, and not a bear.) As far as I can tell, the purpose of changing “non-” 非 to the homophonous “flying” 飛 is consistency with “singing phoenix” 鳴鳳 and “hiding dragon” 臥龍, the latter just meaning “undiscovered genius.”


But there’s another layer to these lines too:

- Drew Gibson pointed out on Bluesky that a “two-headed snake” 兩頭蛇 was considered such a baleful animal that anyone who saw one would drop dead.

- “Five-eyed rooster” 五眼鷄 sounds like 烏眼雞, “black-eyed rooster,” meaning either a look of bitter hatred or, by extension, both hater and hatee.

- And according to the 16th-century bibliophile Lang Ying 郎瑛, a “three-legged cat” 三腳貓 was someone who couldn’t do anything right (俗以事不盡善者，謂之三腳貓), though he does note, in fairness, that during the reign of the Jiajing Emperor there was a Daoist monk in Nanjing who kept a three-legged cat that was an excellent mouser despite not being able to walk right (極善捕鼠而走不成步).


Oh, and if you were wondering, “seven-figure salary” is literally “ten thousand \[large measures of grain\],” i.e. a ludicrously high official salary. I was trying to keep the numbers going, but “seven-figure salary” sounds way too contemporary and it probably won’t survive into future drafts.

The original text for the caption below is '真希望在电影里过日子，下一个镜头就是一行字幕：多年以后。'](images/babble-and-cant-and-flummery/e9f4607f-dadf-4d37-b7c5-3d59fe171fa1.heic)](images/babble-and-cant-and-flummery/e9f4607f-dadf-4d37-b7c5-3d59fe171fa1.heic)“I _wish_ life was like the movies. Next shot, title card: ‘MANY YEARS LATER.’”

But it _did_ remind me of something else — a [passage](https://book.douban.com/annotation/90666771/) from the late-1989 (!) _Not Even Human_ (千万别把我当人) by Wang Shuo 王朔, the king of “lowlife lit” 痞子文学, in which the residents of a Beijing hutong welcome a visiting official in the highest fashion they can manage. I hope you’ll forgive the contemporaneity. It’s just too good:
