# Friday Doggerel: Yang Jingxian - "The Flea"

[![A handsomely produced color print illustration of...bugs. Sorry, I can't describe them intelligently other than to say that there are bugs of various sizes, colors, and proportions depicted here.](/friday-doggerel-yang-jingxian-the-flea/assets/cf6aef19-ce7a-41f2-9e72-52ffd92734d1.jpg)](/friday-doggerel-yang-jingxian-the-flea/assets/cf6aef19-ce7a-41f2-9e72-52ffd92734d1.jpg) Some gnarly-looking little dudes (though no fleas) from _[An Epitome of the Natural History of the Insects of China](https://old.shuge.org/ebook/natural-history-of-the-insects-of-china/)_ (1798)

A bit of doggerel for your weekend, courtesy of the late-Yuan poet and playwright Yang Jingxian 楊景賢:

> 小則小，偏能走跳，
>
> 咬一口一似針挑，
>
> 領兒上走到褲兒腰。
>
> 眼睜睜拿不住，身材兒怎生撈？
>
> 翻個筋鬥不見了。
>
> Small as can be,
>
> The minuscule flea
>
> Can nimbly dance
>
> (With a needle-sharp bite)
>
> From the nape of the neck
>
> To the waist of the pants.
>
> Stare as you may,
>
> Glare as you might,
>
> It’ll give you the slip —
>
> Just a hop and a flip
>
> And it’s vanished from sight.

I’m planning to take a break from literary cats with a few favorite Yuan-dynasty poems next week — you’ll laugh, you’ll cry, you’ll gain a clearer appreciation of the utter insignificance of man in light of eternity. It’ll be fun.
