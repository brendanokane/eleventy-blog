A bit of doggerel for your weekend, courtesy of the late-Yuan poet and playwright Yang Jingxian 楊景賢:

> 小則小，偏能走跳，
> 咬一口一似針挑，
> 領兒上走到褲兒腰。
> 眼睜睜拿不住，身材兒怎生撈？
> 翻個筋鬥不見了。
>
> Small as can be,
> The minuscule flea
> Can nimbly dance
> (With a needle-sharp bite)
> From the nape of the neck
> To the waist of the pants.
> Stare as you may,
> Glare as you might,
> It’ll give you the slip —
> Just a hop and a flip
> And it’s vanished from sight.

I’m planning to take a break from literary cats with [a few favorite Yuan-dynasty poems](/in-defense-of-the-relatively-low-quality/)) next week — you’ll laugh, you’ll cry, you’ll [gain a clearer appreciation of the utter insignificance of man in light of eternity](/spring-and-stone-and-the-total-perspective-vortex/). It’ll be fun.
