# Two Poems for a Rainy Sunday

> 風卷江湖雨暗村，四山聲作海濤翻。
> 溪柴火軟蠻氈暖，我與狸奴不出門。

> Wind sweeps lake and river, rain darkens the village;
> the mountains roar and crash like ocean waves.
> The kindling fire burns gently, the wool felt blankets are warm —
> My cat and I will _not_ be going out.

I’m on the bus back from a friend’s wedding in Jersey City and it is grey, sodden, and altogether Irish out, so naturally I thought of the Southern Song poet and historian Lu You 陸游 (1125-1210), who liked {% mn "long titles" %}My favorite: “Mice Kept Destroying My Books. The Cat I Ended Up Getting Wouldn’t Let A Day Go By Without Catching and Killing At Least One Mouse, So Now Practically All The Mice Have Fled, Which Is Why I Wrote This Poem” (鼠屢敗吾書，偶得狸奴，捕殺無虛日，群鼠幾空，為賦此詩).{% endmn %} almost as much as he liked cats and hardline irredentism. <sup class="mn-marker" data-mn-id="mn-1" aria-controls="mn-1" aria-expanded="false" title="Toggle note">※</sup> Lu’s body of work, not necessarily the greatest but certainly the _largest_ of any pre-15th century poet, records the progress of his ailurophilia and/or toxoplasmosis <sup class="mn-marker" data-mn-id="mn-2" aria-controls="mn-2" aria-expanded="false" title="Toggle note">※</sup> and I’m sure I’ll be returning to it at greater length in drier, warmer weather too— the man had so many damn poems.

I’m making this up. I’ve made no attempt to date or periodize these poems, which appear here in the order I found them in my “stuff to do some day” jumble drawer file, where I pasted them from unknown and not necessarily accurate sources. Do not make any major life or investment decisions on the basis of this e-mail about cats. There could be _typos_ here, for all I know!

That said, please do let me know if you’ve got an edition of Lu’s poems that does have reliable/ish dates, or know more about his life and work than I do, which is not all that much. (And statistically speaking I haven’t read him at all: Lu is singlehandedly responsible for approximately 4% of the _Complete_ Shi _-Poems of the Song Dynasty_ 全宋詩, and the Song did not as a dynasty suffer from a shortage of poetry. He left behind thousands of poems, and for all I know they could all be bangers.)

> He must’ve been my servant in some past life,

Stay warm and dry out there — and if any of you feel good about your ability to read formal Qing-dynasty prose, I’ve got a couple of questions I’d love to pick your brain about. This post was supposed to be a translation of a formal declaration of war against a lazy chonk who failed to perform his mousing duties, but a couple of things at the end of the text are giving me trouble.
