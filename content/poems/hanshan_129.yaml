    He's going places, that young lad:
    So deeply versed! So widely read!
    We all address him as "Master" now,
    and he's sure to make Academician —
    But he hasn't been able to find a position,
    and he's useless when it's time to plow.
    Shivering in his rags all winter long,
    He wonders if his books have led him wrong.

    雍容美少年，博覽諸經史。
    盡號曰先生，皆稱為學士。
    未能得官職，不解秉耒耜。
    冬披破布衫，蓋是書誤己。
