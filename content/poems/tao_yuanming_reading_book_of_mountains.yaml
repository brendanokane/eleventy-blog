    The first month of summer: everything is growing,
       and the trees around my cottage have all filled in.
    The birds exult in their new lodgings,
       and I the fonder of my little home.
    And the ploughing is done, and the planting is all finished,
       and it's time again for me to read my books.
    (My lane is narrow, and off the beaten track,
       which tends to turn friends' carriages away.)
    There's a spring in my step as I pour a cup of homebrew,
       and pick some vegetables from the garden plot;
    And a fine rain coming in from the east,
       with a pleasant breeze for company.
    I browse The Voyages of the King of Zhou,
       drift over The Book of Mountains and Seas.
    When I look back up, I've covered the entire world --
    If that's not joy, then I don't know what is.

    孟夏草木長，遶屋樹扶疏。眾鳥欣有託，吾亦愛吾廬。
    既耕亦已種，時還讀我書。窮巷隔深轍，頗迴故人車。
    歡然酌春酒，摘我園中蔬。微雨從東來，好風與之俱。
    泛覽周王傳，流觀山海圖。俯仰終宇宙，不樂復何如？
