    Li Biao wrote:
    Around her door as spring grows late
    the flowering trees blow to and fro.
    In search of finer sights, the prince
    shakes off his dusty robe —
    But the immortal of this grotto,
    being overly amorous,
    Holds young Liu back —
    She just can't let him go.

    Wang Susu replied:
    No wonder all the dogs are barking,
    the chickens fluttering to and fro:
    A scrawny boy, a skinny nag,
    a worn-out, tattered hempen robe.
    Who brought this good-for-nothing
    in the first place anyway?
    The cash can stay —
    The customer can go.

    李標題:
    春暮花株繞戶飛，王孫尋勝引塵衣。
    洞中仙子多情態，留住劉郎不放歸。

    蘇蘇繼:
    怪得犬驚雞亂飛，羸童瘦馬老麻衣。
    阿誰亂引閒人到，留住青蚨熱趕歸。
