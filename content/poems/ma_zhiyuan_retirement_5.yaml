    On the road. Moon overhead,
    And stars around your shoulders for a cape.
    Some backwoods inn just after spring's last frost,
    Returning home in fall to find
    Your wife and children gained the weight you lost.
    Late nights fretting,
    Days distressed —
    Dying, literally, for a rest.
  zh: |
    帶月行，披星走，
    孤館寒食故鄉秋。
    妻兒胖了咱消瘦。
    枕上憂，馬上愁，死後休。
