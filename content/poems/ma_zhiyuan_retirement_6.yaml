    Heap it up you may,
    And rake it in —
    But even then will come the day
    Death sweeps your doings all away.
    What then?
    Why miss a pleasant view, a sunny day?
    Why let the chance of a happy hour pass,
    With liquid amber glinting in the glass
    As bright teeth flash in song, musicians play,
    And slender waists to citterns sway —
    Life's best lived the free and easy way.

    白玉堆，黃金垛，
    一日無常果如何？
    良辰媚景休空過。
    琉璃鐘琥珀濃，
    細腰舞皓齒歌，
    倒大來閑快活。
