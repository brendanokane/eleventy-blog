    My cat Five White. After I got you,
    The mice stopped nibbling at my books.
    This morning, Five White, you died.
    I made offerings of rice and fish,
    Left them with you in the middle of the river,
    Chanted prayers — to send you off, not to send you away.
    I remember how you caught a mouse
    And ran around the yard with it, crowing,
    To put a fright into the other mice
    And clear them out of my little home.
    From the day we came aboard this boat,
    We shared a room and meager board.
    Dry rations, and little enough of them —
    It would have been rat turds and scraps
    If it wasn't for you. You did your job
    and worked harder than any chicken or pig.
    People care only for beasts of burden,
    Praise only the donkey and the horse —
    Well, let them. I've no heart to argue.
    I'll be weeping for you a while yet.

    自有五白貓，鼠不侵我書
    今朝五白死，祭與飯與魚
    送之於中河，呪爾非爾疏
    昔爾嚙一鼠，銜鳴遶庭除
    欲使眾鼠驚，意將清我廬
    一從登舟來，舟中同屋居
    糗糧雖其薄，免食漏竊餘
    此實爾有勤，有勤勝雞豬
    世人重驅駕，謂不如馬驢
    已矣莫復論，為爾聊郗歔。
