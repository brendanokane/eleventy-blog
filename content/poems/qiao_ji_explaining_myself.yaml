    I didn't ace the Examination
    	or make it to the Final Ten.
    I won't be up for celebration
    	in Biographies of Worthy Men.
    But I play the Sage of Drinking now and then —
      and, here and there, find inspiration
         for poetic Zen.

    I'm a demimonde valedictorian,
       transcendently boozy
          and far past reformation,
    Laughingly playing Imperial Historian
       as I judge the world
          for praise or condemnation.

    I   r o a m,
    My friends and peers —
    Jotting comments on the wind my only occupation,
       footnoting the moonlight for my poems
          these forty years.

    不占龍頭選，不入名賢傳。
    時時酒聖，處處詩禪，
    煙霞狀元，江湖醉仙，
    笑談便是編修院。
    留連，
    批風抹月四十年。
