    I built my cottage in the realm of men,
    and yet there's no clamor of carriages or horses.
    How, you ask, can it be so?
    When the mind is detached, one's place becomes remote.
    I pick chrysanthemums by the eastern hedge,
    catch sight of the southern mountain in the distance.
    The mist on the mountain is radiant in twilight;
    birds on the wing make their way home together.
    In all this there's some truer meaning —
    I'd tell you, only I've forgot the words.

    結廬在人境，而無車馬喧。
    問君何能爾，心遠地自偏。
    採菊東籬下，悠然見南山。
    山氣日夕佳，飛鳥相與還。
    此中有真意，欲辨已忘言。
