    For a bag of salt I engaged a cat.
    Now I watch him bat his toys around on my seat.
    On occasion and catnip he loses his mind,
    and he hogs the blankets every night.
    Back from the mouse-hole, the day's work done,
    He knows I'll reward him with fish for a treat.
    All that remains is to give him a name—
    I think "Little Tygre" sounds right.

    鹽裹聘狸奴，常看戲座隅。
    時時醉薄荷，夜夜佔氍毹。
    鼠穴功方列，魚餐賞豈無。
    仍當立名字，喚作小於菟。
