    Autumn's come.
       I look at you:
          Still a tumbleweed adrift.
    Still no key
       To immortality.
          You're no master alchemist.
    Rip-roaring drunk,
       Bellowing songs,
          Empty day emptying into empty day.
    Your flourishes,
       All your bravado —
          Whose hero are you playing?

    秋來相顧尚飄蓬， 未就丹砂愧葛洪。
    痛飲狂歌空度日， 飛揚跋扈為誰雄？
