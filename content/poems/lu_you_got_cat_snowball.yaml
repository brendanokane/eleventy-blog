    Like a tiger if it could climb a tree,
    Or a colt that wouldn't pull a cart,
    So dead-set on his mousing
    That he has no time for fish.
    On catnip and occasion he loses himself,
    and every night he keeps my blankets warm—
    He must've been my servant in some past life,
    Keeping me company through age and rustication.

    似虎能緣木，如駒不伏轅。
    但知空鼠穴，無意為魚餐。
    薄荷時時醉，氍毹夜夜溫。
    前生舊童子，伴我老山村。
