    Hair gone grey,
    Past middle-age,
    And what was all the fuss for, anyway?
    Doghouse and demand —
    You've been in both too, in your day.
    Plant the seeds of softer times, and tend
    To your little plot of land.
    Leave the racing to the rats —
    That game's too mean and I wouldn't play.
    Life's best lived the free and easy way.

    兩鬢皤，中年過，
    圖甚區區苦張羅？
    人間龐辱都參破。
    種春風二頃田，
    遠紅塵千丈波動，
    倒大來閑快活。
