    Peach blossoms long to last the summer through,
    But by wind and moon are driven ceaselessly.
    Search as you may for the people of the Han,
    There's nary a one alive today.
    Dawn after dawn, the flowers aged and fell;
    Year in, year out, the people moved and changed.
    There, where your foot kicks up the dust —
    That once was sea.

    桃花欲經夏， 風月催不待。
    訪覓漢時人， 能無一箇在。
    朝朝花遷落， 歲歲人移改。
    今日揚塵處， 昔時為大海。
