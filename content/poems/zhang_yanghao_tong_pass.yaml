    The peaks of Mount Hua muster in,
    The waves of the Yellow River rage.
    Threading through mountain and river it runs:
              The road up to Tong Pass.
    I pause
              and gaze west toward the capital that was:
    Where Qin and Han and Tang passed through,
    And every one of their palaces turned to dust.
    Dynasties
              rise: the little people suffer.
              fall: the little people suffer.

    峯巒如聚，波濤如怒，
    山河表裏潼關路。
    望西都，意躊躇。
    傷心秦漢經行處，
    宮闕萬間都做了土。
    興，百姓苦；
    亡，百姓苦！
