    You could have risen to the top.
    The sky was no limit for ambition's call —
    But fate said it was not to be.
    Stop beating your head against that wall.
    Forget old victories and defeats
    And spend your days whatever way seems best.
    Cotton sheets,
    A blanket nest —
    Warm enough is enough. Now rest.

    佐國心，拿雲手，
    命裏無時莫剛求。
    隨時過遣休生受。
    幾葉綿，一片綢，暖後休。
