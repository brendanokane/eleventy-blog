    Fearsome enough the storms of life,
    So guard your lips and tongue.
    If _this_ duck has short legs, and _that_ crane long,
    They are as Heaven made them.
    So a word to the "fishermen" commentators
    And the "woodsman" pundits who debate them:
    Cease your talk of _worthy men_
    And go light on the _idiots_, too —
    "Who finds the Way finds help along his way;
    Whoever strays will find his friends are few."
    — _Worthy_'s a word for someone else,
    And _idiot_'s not up to you.

    風波實怕，唇舌休掛，
    鶴長鳧短天生下。
    勸漁家，共樵家，
    從今莫講賢愚話，
    得道多助失道寡。
    賢，也在他；
    愚，也在他。
