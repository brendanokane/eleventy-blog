    One day, through all the smithy of Creation,
    Ashes will cool where now the fire rages.
    And what then, after all the ages?
    Fortresses fallen to desolation,
    Old trees the graves of palaces,
    Mighty Mount Tai, worn to a whetstone,
    A narrow band that was the Yellow River —
    And even these soon dust forever.
    No sense in sighing
    At flowers blooming and dying in the blast:
    The spring is past. Next year will bring
    Another and another spring.

    茫茫大塊洪爐裏，何物不寒灰？
    古今多少 荒煙廢壘 老樹遺臺
    太山如礪 黃河如帯 等是塵埃
    不須更嘆 花開花落 春去春來
