    There are no readers at the top —
    Illiterate? You'll benefit. And praise
    Is the prize for idiocy nowadays.
    For Heaven won't discriminate
    Between the low-down and the great,
    And men have never understood
    The difference between bad and good.
    So mock the poor. Defraud the kind.
    Watch anyone with learning fall behind.
    Or practice your calligraphy
    And study your epigraphy: You'll find
    The learned and the competent
    Are worth less than a copper cent.

    不讀書最高，不識字最好，
    不曉事倒有人誇俏。
    老天不肯辨清濁，好和歹沒條道。
    善的人欺，貧的人笑，讀書人都累倒。
    立身則小學，修身則大學，
    智和能都不及鴨青鈔。
