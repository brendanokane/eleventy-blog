    Broke scholars who can't catch a break,
    Hungry and cold as hungry and cold can be,
    Versifying in your abundant leisure,
    Sweating and straining for effortless poetry —
    Low as you are, who'd listen to your words?
    I'm telling you: Quit moaning and groaning.
    Write your verses on a bun
    And the starvingest street dog would leave it alone.

    蹭蹬諸貧士， 飢寒成至極。
    閑居好作詩， 札札用心力。
    賤他言孰采， 勸君休歎息。
    題安糊䴵上， 乞狗也不喫。
