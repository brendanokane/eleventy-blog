    And how have I been spending my time?
    I've been here in Shaqiu: splendid isolation.
    There are old trees by the city walls,
    And day and night the autumn whispers through them.
    Shandong wine can't get me drunk.
    The local poets leave me cold.
    I'm thinking of you: thoughts like the River Wen,
    Surging, churning, ever south.

    我來竟何事，⾼臥沙丘城。
    城邊有古樹，⽇夕連秋聲。
    魯酒不可醉，⿑歌空復情。
    思君若汶⽔，浩蕩寄南征。
