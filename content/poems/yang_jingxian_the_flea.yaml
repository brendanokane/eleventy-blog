    Small as can be,
    The minuscule flea
    Can nimbly dance
    (With a needle-sharp bite)
    From the nape of the neck
    To the waist of the pants.
    Stare as you may,
    Glare as you might,
    It'll give you the slip —
    Just a hop and a flip
    And it's vanished from sight.

    小則小，偏能走跳，
    咬一口一似針挑，
    領兒上走到褲兒腰。
    眼睜睜拿不住，身材兒怎生撈？
    翻個筋鬥不見了。
