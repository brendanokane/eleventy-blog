    In vain I read the Histories;
    My efforts with the Classics all were wasted.
    I'll be on tax rolls til I'm old,
    and marked down always as a nobody.
    Cast my fortune — all I get is "Don't."
    A whole life governed by ill-omened stars.
    I should have been a tree beside a river.
    At least I'd get to flourish once a year.

    徒勞說三史，浪自看五經。
    洎老檢黃籍，依前注白丁。
    筮遭連蹇卦，生主虛危星。
    不及河邊樹，年年一度青。
