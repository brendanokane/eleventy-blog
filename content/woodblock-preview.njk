# Woodblock preview (typography + margin notes)

This is a temporary sandbox page to iterate on typography, quotations, poetry formatting, and margin note placement before we migrate the rest of the theme.

## Margin note demo

Here is a sentence with an in-flow anchor {% mn "that has a margin note" %}This margin note should align vertically to the anchor text in the main paragraph, and use a smaller sans-serif face.{% endmn %} and continues after it.

Here is a second anchor {% mn "nearby" %}This is another margin note placed close to the previous one, to help test collisions/overlaps and vertical rhythm.{% endmn %} to stress the layout.

## Quotation styling

> This is a blockquote. Ultimately, blockquotes are for actual quotations, so we want indentation but no border highlight or italics.

## Poetry / preformatted demo

<pre>
The river bends, the moon is high,
A boatman's song goes drifting by.
</pre>
