            <p>
              So you're reading <em>The Romance of the Western Chamber</em> 西廂記, as one does, and you're reading it in an old woodblock edition, because obviously, and you're hooked. Young Student Zhang has driven away the Flying Tiger and his bandits, and for a moment it looks like there'll be nothing more to stand in the way of his marriage to the well-bred Cui Yingying – but Yingying's mother is having second thoughts about the promise she made. The young lovers have been relying on Yingying's sassy maidservant Hongniang to pass messages, but Yingying's mother is onto them.

              Is all hope lost? (No.) Will true love prevail? (Yes.) But before you can find out what happens next, you’re confronted with a chatty little digression from the commentator: a list of delightful things, each ending with the words 不亦快哉 <em>bù yì kuài zāi</em> — “Is <em>that</em> not a delight?”
              <details class="mn">
                <summary class="mn-marker" aria-label="Margin note">※</summary>
                <div class="mn-content">
                  <p>Lin Yutang's translation, the only other one I know of in English, consistently renders <em>bù yì kuài zāi</em> as “Ah, is this not happiness?” while Pierre Ryckmans' French translation goes with “Ah, quel délice!” throughout.</p>
                  <p>I vary the translation from item to item, and leave it off entirely after number 26, because I felt like it and because Jin Shengtan is, as of this writing, at least 361 years beyond caring one way or the other.</p>

              This is Jin Shengtan's 金聖嘆 "Thirty-three Nice Things" 不亦快哉三十三則, a digression so powerful that it broke free of its original context to become widely known and beloved in its own right, even among the sort of people who do not habitually read pre-20th century editions of 17th-century commentaries on 13th-century updates of 12th-century dramatizations of 9th-century romantic fiction. I thought I might cheer myself up by translating it, and when I was done I thought my friends might enjoy it. I hope you will too.

              昔與斵山同客共住，霖雨十日，對床無聊，因約賭說快事，以破積悶。至今相距既二十年，亦都不自記憶。偶因讀《西廂》至“拷豔”一篇，見紅娘口中作如許快文，恨當時何不檢取共讀，何積悶之不破。於是反自追索，猶憶得數則，附之左方。但不能辨何句是斵山語，何句是聖嘆語矣。

              I’m on a little boat when a favorable wind rises, and me without a sail to catch it. A big junk passes, moving quick as the wind, and since I’ve nothing better to do I try throwing my grapnel at it a few times. It catches, to my surprise, and the cable drags me along in the larger boat’s wake, singing Du Fu’s “Unmooring”

              We'll leave Jin Shengtan here for now, reading his books and remembering happier times. The next time we check in with him it'll be almost a quarter century after his conversation with Zhuoshan. We'll talk about snappy retorts, vegetarian ham recipes, official corruption, the transfer of New World food crops, and one last ‘ <em>bù yì kuài zāi</em>.’ There'll be some ground to cover between now and then, and probably a lot of tangents, detours, and wild goose chases — but hopefully it'll be worth the going.
